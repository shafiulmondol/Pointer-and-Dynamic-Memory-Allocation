## Introduction

Pointers and dynamic memory allocation are fundamental aspects of C++ programming that allow efficient and flexible management of memory. This repository is dedicated to providing examples and detailed explanations to help developers:

- Understand the concept of pointers.
- Manage dynamic memory efficiently.
- Avoid common pitfalls such as memory leaks and dangling pointers.

## Features

- **Examples:** A variety of examples demonstrating the use of pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
- **Explanations:** Detailed documentation accompanying the examples.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Tips and tricks to avoid common issues.
- **Best Practices:** Guidance on efficient and safe memory management.

## Prerequisites

To work with the code in this repository, you need:

- A basic understanding of C++.
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shafiulmondol/Pointer-and-Dynamic-Memory-Allocation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Pointer-and-Dynamic-Memory-Allocation
   ```

3. Compile the examples:

   ```bash
   g++ -o example examples/example1.cpp
   ```

## Usage

1. Explore the examples directory to find specific use cases.
2. Run compiled examples to see how pointers and dynamic memory allocation work in practice:

   ```bash
   ./example
   ```

3. Modify the examples or create your own programs to experiment further.

## Examples

The repository includes examples such as:

- **Basic Pointer Usage:** Declaring, initializing, and dereferencing pointers.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:** Using `new` and `delete` operators.
- **Smart Pointers:** Introduction to modern C++ smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr`).
- **Avoiding Memory Leaks:** Best practices and tools for debugging.
